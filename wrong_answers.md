TRUE coz sets order dont matter

what does the break do?
Immediately exits the loop

print((1,2)+(3,4))
gives (1,2,3,4)

BODMAS
print("a"+"bc"*2)
"abcbc"

whatdoes this code output? tuple= (1,2,[3,4]); tuple[2][0]=7; print(tuple)
(1,2,[7,4])

predict the output: a, *_, b = range(5);print (a+b)
4 because range starts from 0 and ends at 4

What will print([x for x in "python" if x in "aeiou"]) output?
['o'] returns a list with only o in

floor division is the lesser side.
